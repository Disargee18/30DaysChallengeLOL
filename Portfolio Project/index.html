            <div class="box2">
                <p style="position: absolute;"><b>movies and shows.</b> i watch very little shows and movies that this might probably not going to be a very accurate way of digging in to my deepest and darkest secrets, but i do have some very cool and niche faves so yeah</p>

            </div>
            <div class="box3">
                <p style="position: absolute;"><b>my take on things, styles, hobbies, niches, and just aabout any thing that i like in this world.</b> this will most likely showcase my peculiarities, and me being pretentious (not performative) but yeah i dont really know what im gonna put here lol</p>
